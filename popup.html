          team’s dedication has proved to be a great asset, inspiring our
          clients’ support, loyalty, and satisfaction through the past many
          years. DISCLAIMER This website XXXXXXXX ("Website") is a public
          resource for general information about Karan Chaudhary Law Associates.
          The material on our Web site has been prepared and published for
          general information only. There is no effort or intention to solicit
          new clients or new engagements from existing clients by way of this
          website. The information contained in this website is provided by

          reference or legal advice. Karan Chaudhary Law Associates does not
          sponsor reliance upon, or accept responsibility for the information
          Karan Chaudhary Law Associates provides or for the way in which this

          of the attorney-client relationship would require direct, personal
          contact between you and our firm through one or more attorneys and

          letter" by the firm that confirms that an attorney-client relationship
          is established and the terms of that relationship. You should not act

          other matter. Each legal matter should be considered on the unique
          facts of each case. Karan Chaudhary Law Associates has endeavored to
          comply with all applicable legal and ethical requirements in compiling
